LibVLC on Android demo
======================

This is a sample application demonstrating the use of libVLC on Android.

This repository contains only sample code, and the libVLC on Android sdk (*vlc-sdk.7z*) must be built and placed into the target application's source code directory.

Getting started
---------------
Requirements:

* An up-to-date Linux distribution.
  * This is because VLC (and VLC for Android) uses autotools and make in order to be portable to so many diverse platforms.
  * [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/) is always an option if Linux is not available natively on the computer.
* Android NDK r9
* Android SDK
* [Any other pieces of software](https://wiki.videolan.org/AndroidCompile#Requirements) listed in the compile guide.

First build VLC for Android:

**Note**: Recently significant LibVLC for Android API changes have been committed, and as such this sample will need to be updated. *In the meantime*, an older revision of VLC for Android can be used, such as http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc-ports/android.git;a=commitdiff;h=b01969a4bfe1b2fa4580f5e8df08dc29566d7a16

To do this, after running ```git clone git://git.videolan.org/vlc-ports/android.git```, run ```git checkout b01969a4bfe1b2fa4580f5e8df08dc29566d7a16```. Restore the repository with ```git checkout master```.

1. Follow [AndroidCompile](https://wiki.videolan.org/AndroidCompile) and build VLC for Android.
2. In the same build directory, run ```make .sdk```
3. Copy everything (libs and src) inside the **vlc-sdk/** directory to the application source directory (the one containing AndroidManifest.xml).

Now, just build your application, in Eclipse, ant, or any other tool of your choice.

Debugging
---------

Having problems making some media play?

Use [**adb logcat**](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/logcat.html) to read the debug logs. This is analogous to Tools â†’ Messages (verbosity 2) in desktop VLC.

In addition, try different configurations of hardware acceleration, chroma, and deblocking. Android devices vary greatly in their capabilities.
